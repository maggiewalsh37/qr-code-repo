While working through this challenge I gained a better understanding on how to wrap images in containers using div elements.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

In future projects I look forward to working on my use of flexbox and grip properties.
